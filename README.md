tangram
=======

This is a JavaScript implementation of the
[Tangram puzzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangram).

The directory extern contains [jQuery library](http://jquery.com/),
[jQuery UI library](http://jqueryui.com/) and
[Konva library](https://konvajs.github.io/). There is a shell script
unpack.sh there to unpack the libraries to a given directory.

The directory src contains source files. To start, say make libs and
open tangram.html in a browser. To make a distribution in bin
directory, say make rel.

The directory doc contains an auxiliary latex file.
